## About SignalR Progress Demo

This repository shows two patterns for server->browser async reporting of long-running task results using SignalR core. A running example can be found at: https://signalrprogress.azurewebsites.net/. The Home page is a simplified example using SignalR with an Ajax POST and the NoPost page shows a more worked-up example - a little more complex and 'real' with multiple message types (and no POSTs :-)).

There is a [walk-through of the Async POST pattern](https://github.com/endintiers/SignalR-AspNetCore-ProgressDemo/blob/master/AsyncPOST.md) (simplified: best place to start) and a [walk-through of the No POST pattern](https://github.com/endintiers/SignalR-AspNetCore-ProgressDemo/blob/master/NoPOST.md) which is more complex/real.
